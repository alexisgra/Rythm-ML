# Syntax Highlighting for VSCode

In order to user this VSCode extension, you just need to copy/paste this current folder
`syntax-highlighting` into your extensions folder of VSCode generally located in 
`<USER_DIRECTORY>/.vscode/extensions` and then restart VSCode.

Your file **must** have the `.rythm` extension, you can find examples 
[here](../dsl/src/main/resources/scenario).
